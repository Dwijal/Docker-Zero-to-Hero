FROM ubuntu: latest'

# Set the working directory in the image
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the files from the host file system to the image file system
COPY .  /app

# Install the necessary packages inside Container
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Set environment variables
ENV NAME World

# Run a command to start the application
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]


ENTRYPOINT [""]

CMD ["",""]

1)Both entrypoint and cmd is used as start point for the container when we execute docker run command

Use ENTRYPOINT for the main command.
Use CMD for default arguments or a fallback command that can be overridden.

Eg.
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "app.py"]
CMD ["--help"]

When the container runs, it will execute python3 app.py --help by default.
If you run the container with docker run myimage --version, it will execute python3 app.py --version instead.

2)Docker file should be saved as "Dockerfile" only.

docker build -t my-app:1.0 filelocation



3)If we are doing changes in the docker file then we have to rebuild the image again.
